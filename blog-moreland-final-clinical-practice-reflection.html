        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past 12 weeks of my final Clinical Practice as a chemistry
          teacher candidate at Moreland University, I have experienced profound
          growth in my teaching practice. This period has been a journey of
          applying theory to classroom reality, reflecting deeply on each
          lesson, and embracing feedback from mentors, instructors, and peers.
          In this reflection, I blend personal narrative with professional
          analysis to recount how I refined my teaching techniques through
          continuous improvement. I also align my development with the InTASC
          standards - a set of 10 core standards designed to promote effective
          teaching and growth (Council of Chief State School Officers [CCSSO],
          2013). From enhancing student engagement and formative assessment
          strategies to integrating digital tools and project-based learning, I
          illustrate clear improvement in instructional effectiveness. I close
          with gratitude, an awareness of next steps, and a statement of my
          professional identity and commitment as an educator.
        </p>

        <h2>Growth Over 12 Weeks: Embracing Feedback and Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Walking into my classroom 12 weeks ago, I felt both excited and
          uncertain. Today, I can see how much I have grown, thanks to a cycle
          of feedback and reflection. Early on, my mentor teacher observed my
          lessons twice a week and provided constructive "glows and grows." For
          example, in the first week she noted that while I explained chemistry
          content clearly (a glow), I needed to improve wait-time after asking
          questions (grow). I took this to heart and deliberately paused longer,
          which soon led to more student hands raised. Similarly, my university
          supervisor and course instructor gave feedback on lesson plans and
          observed teachings; their comments pushed me to refine my
          instructional planning and delivery. I recorded several classes and
          engaged in peer video reviews, where colleagues annotated my videos
          with feedback. This was eye-opening - a peer pointed out that I tended
          to call on the same few students. In response, I implemented a
          randomized name picker and small-group discussions, ensuring every
          learner's voice was heard. Through such iterations, I embraced
          continuous learning and improvement, welcoming every opportunity to
          evolve as an educator (Darling-Hammond et al., 2017). I strove to
          become the kind of reflective practitioner who continually evaluates
          the effects of my teaching on students and adapts my approach to meet
          each learner's needs (CCSSO, 2013). The evidence of growth was
          apparent: by week 12, my mentor remarked that my classroom had
          transformed into a more student-centered, engaging environment than it
          was at the start.
        </p>

        <h2>Video Lessons and Peer-Evaluated Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most impactful professional learning experiences was
          analyzing my teaching through video lessons. Mid-way through the
          practicum, I filmed a chemistry lesson on balancing chemical equations
          and shared it with peers for evaluation. Using an annotation tool,
          they left timestamped comments on everything from my pacing to student
          engagement levels. Initially, watching myself teach was daunting, but
          it led to powerful insights. I noticed, for instance, that I spent too
          much time lecturing and not enough time checking for student
          understanding. A peer's comment - "Consider inserting a quick
          formative check here" - prompted me to integrate a short poll in my
          next lesson. I also saw moments where student attention wavered, which
          aligned with my mentor's earlier feedback about varying my
          instructional strategies. Taking these observations, I refined my
          techniques: in subsequent lessons I broke content into smaller chunks,
          incorporated think-pair-share discussions after each chunk, and used
          visual aids to maintain interest. The improvement was clear in the
          next video review; peers noted that students appeared far more engaged
          and participatory. This cycle of plan - teach - video - peer review -
          adjust became a cornerstone of my growth. It not only honed specific
          skills (like clearer board work and better questioning techniques) but
          also instilled in me the habit of ongoing professional learning and
          evidence-based self-evaluation, exactly as InTASC Standard 9 envisions
          for effective teachers (CCSSO, 2013). By critically reviewing my own
          practice and acting on feedback, I became more intentional and
          reflective, qualities that I will carry forward into my teaching
          career.

        <h2>Strategies for Student Engagement and Formative Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          Increasing student engagement and strengthening formative assessment
          were two priority areas in my teaching practice. Over the 12 weeks, I
          implemented several specific strategies to make my chemistry classes
          more interactive and to use assessment data to drive instruction. Key
          strategies included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Project-Based Learning with Real-World Context:</strong> I
            designed authentic science inquiries, most notably the IonicFix
            water chemistry PBL unit, to tap into student curiosity. This PBL
            embodied sustained inquiry, real-world authenticity, student
            voice/choice, critique and revision, and a public product - all
            hallmarks of gold-standard PBL (PBLWorks, n.d.). For example,
            students investigated a local water quality issue and proposed
            solutions, which kept them highly motivated. Adopting a fun "Shark
            Tank" style pitch for project presentations further increased
            engagement while still demanding academic precision in chemistry
            reasoning and evidence-based planning (Hamari et al., 2014).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gamified and Interactive Techniques:</strong> To grab
            attention and make learning fun, I infused lessons with interactive
            digital polls and challenges. The Shark Tank pitch mentioned above
            gamified the presentation experience, and I also used quick games
            like chemistry bingo and online quiz competitions. These
            age-appropriate formats boosted motivation without sacrificing rigor
            (Hamari et al., 2014), as students eagerly participated in order to
            "win" while still practicing key vocabulary and problem-solving.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Embedded Formative Assessments:</strong> I wove multiple
            formative checkpoints into every lesson to monitor understanding in
            real time. For instance, I frequently kicked off class with a
            Curipod word cloud or quick poll to gauge prior knowledge or moods.
            This provided instant class-wide data to surface misconceptions and
            adjust my lesson on the fly (Black &amp; Wiliam, 1998). During
            lessons, I used "spot the mistake" diagnostic prompts and
            mid-lesson checks (like one-minute quiz questions or having students
            solve a problem on mini whiteboards) to ensure students were on
            track. Every lesson ended with a targeted exit ticket (often via
            Formative.com or Microsoft Forms) so I could quickly see who had
            mastered the day's objective and who needed reteaching (Black &amp;
            Wiliam, 1998; Heritage, 2010). By balancing these objective-aligned
            formative assessments with occasional summative quizzes, I used data
            to drive my instruction daily.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Timely Feedback and Revision Opportunities:</strong> I
            established routines for giving timely, actionable feedback and
            creating time for students to use that feedback. One strategy was a
            peer review carousel: students rotated in groups to review each
            other's lab plans or reports using a Glow/Grow feedback checklist,
            leaving at least one "Glow" (strength) and one "Grow" (suggestion)
            for improvement. This structured peer critique not only engaged
            students as collaborators but also trained them to think critically
            about quality work. It produced documented feedback for each group
            and was followed by requiring each team to submit a brief "Revision
            Plan" of the changes they would make based on the feedback. I also
            gave quick micro-conferences - e.g., a one-minute chat with each
            group during work time - to provide one targeted next step, which
            I'd record in their Teams chat for reference. Because students knew
            they would immediately revise their work, they took the feedback
            more seriously. This feedback loop echoes widely used
            assessment-for-learning principles emphasizing timely feedback and
            instructional responsiveness (Hattie &amp; Timperley, 2007; Nicol
            &amp; Macfarlane-Dick, 2006). It was rewarding to see students
            improve their work within the same lesson or by the next day, a
            clear indication that formative assessment was improving their
            learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Differentiation and Inclusive Practices:</strong> To keep
            every student engaged, I differentiated my instruction based on
            formative data. For example, during the IonicFix project, after
            reviewing exit ticket responses I grouped students by need: those
            who were secure moved on to an extension activity, while those
            needing support got a mini-lesson re-teach the next day. I prepared
            "ion menus" and scaffolded guides for groups that were stuck during
            the project, and provided challenge problems for advanced learners.
            I also varied modalities - incorporating visuals, hands-on
            experiments, discussions, and written reflections - so that learners
            with different strengths could all access the content. These
            approaches created a more inclusive environment (addressing InTASC
            Standards 1 and 2 on learner development and differences) and kept
            students of all backgrounds engaged. I learned to continuously
            monitor and adjust supports mid-lesson, for instance by offering
            alternative methods when I saw several groups struggling (Tomlinson,
            2017; CAST, 2018). By embedding multiple ways to demonstrate
            learning (written, oral, visual) and by encouraging student
            self-assessment against criteria, I enabled each student to find
            success (CAST, 2018). My classroom evolved into a place where it was
            normal to see different groups doing different tasks - each actively
            learning at their own pace and level.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Implementing these strategies dramatically increased student
          engagement and improved my science instruction. Classroom observations
          showed nearly all students actively participating, whether through
          answering polls, contributing ideas in group work, or giving feedback
          to peers. Moreover, the constant formative feedback meant I was no
          longer "teaching blind" - instead, I had a clear, data-informed
          picture each day of who was grasping the material and who wasn't
          (Black &amp; Wiliam, 1998). This allowed me to be a more responsive
          teacher, adapting my plans to student needs rather than rigidly
          sticking to a script. The result was more effective instruction and
          higher student achievement on end-of-unit assessments, as confirmed by
          my mentor's tracking of scores. In short, engaging students through
          interactive, student-centered techniques and using formative
          assessment as a compass has made me a far more effective science
          teacher than I was 12 weeks ago.
        </p>

        <h2>Integrating Digital Tools and Inquiry-Based Learning</h2>
        <p>
          A significant aspect of my growth was learning to integrate digital
          tools with inquiry-based, student-centered learning. Coming into this
          practicum, I was moderately comfortable with technology but unsure how
          to leverage it meaningfully for learning. Through experimentation and
          advice from peers, I discovered the power of tools like Curipod and
          Formative.com in enhancing inquiry lessons. Curipod became a go-to for
          me - I used its features to create live word clouds and quizzes that
          made classroom brainstorming and diagnostics exciting. For example,
          when starting the IonicFix water chemistry unit, I had students
          respond via Curipod to "In one word, how do you feel about science
          today?" which instantly created a word cloud of their feelings (a mix
          of "curious," "confused," "excited"). Not only did this serve as a
          fun icebreaker, it also gave me a quick read on the class's mindset
          (and even their confidence levels) (Black &amp; Wiliam, 1998). Curipod
          polls also helped us discuss real-world context - I polled "Who is
          affected by water pollution in our community?" and "What constraint
          matters most (cost, safety, time)?" to kick off the project, which
          got students thinking critically and sharing ideas right away
          (PBLWorks, n.d.). Meanwhile, Formative (goformative.com) was
          invaluable for more structured formative assessments. I created online
          quizzes and assignments where students could submit answers that I
          viewed in real time. During a lesson on ionic bonding, I put a few
          practice problems on Formative; as students submitted answers on their
          devices, I could see on my screen who was getting it and who was
          struggling. This immediate insight let me address misconceptions on
          the spot (for instance, re-teaching how to balance charges in ionic
          compounds when I saw 40% of the class missed that question). Students
          later told me they liked the instant feedback they got from
          Formative's auto-grading on some questions, and the fact that I would
          often respond in-app with quick comments or hints for improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond tech tools, I also embraced inquiry-based learning strategies
          such as project-based learning (PBL) and lab investigations. The
          IonicFix unit was the centerpiece of this effort (detailed below), but
          even in regular lessons I shifted toward more inquiry. Instead of
          simply demonstrating chemistry phenomena, I began to pose questions
          and challenges for students to explore. For instance, rather than
          explaining solubility rules outright, I gave small groups different
          salts, water, and a conductivity tester and asked them to investigate
          which solutions conduct electricity and why. This guided inquiry led
          students to discover the concept of ions carrying charge in solution.
          I found that when students had a personal hand in uncovering
          scientific principles, they understood and retained the content
          better. My instructor noted in one observation that I was "facilitating
          learning rather than just dispensing knowledge" - a comment that
          signified a big step forward for me in aligning with InTASC Standard
          5 (connecting concepts to engage learners in problem-solving) and
          Standard 8 (using varied instructional strategies for deep
          understanding) (CCSSO, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
          Crucially, I learned to integrate technology in service of inquiry,
          not as a distraction or gimmick. Each digital tool had a purpose:
          Curipod for capturing student thinking and misconceptions visually,
          Formative for real-time assessment data, and even Microsoft Teams for
          collaboration (students in my classes used Teams to share documents
          and I used it to distribute resources and give feedback). By combining
          these tools with hands-on, minds-on inquiry activities, I created a
          more modern and engaging science classroom. Students were not just
          consuming information; they were using digital platforms to create,
          collaborate, and investigate. One student even commented that our
          classroom felt "like a science lab and a tech startup at the same
          time," which I took as a compliment to the dynamic learning
          environment. Moving forward, I am excited to keep exploring new
          technologies (like simulations, virtual labs, or data analysis tools)
          to further enrich inquiry-based science instruction.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Highlight: The IonicFix PBL Unit (Water Chemistry)</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most transformative experiences of my clinical practice was
          the design and implementation of a student-centered PBL unit called
          "IonicFix." This project-based learning unit was a culmination of
          everything I had been learning about engaging instruction, assessment
          integration, and real-world relevance. The premise of IonicFix was
          that students, as young scientists, were tasked with improving a
          local water quality issue in Thailand. We framed it as: a mysterious
          water symptom (for example, a village stream turning milky-white and
          bitter, with dead shrimp observed) needs investigating and fixing.
          Students worked in teams to identify possible ionic compounds causing
          the issue and then to propose a feasible solution to improve the
          water. The overarching unit goal was for students to apply core
          chemistry concepts (ions, bonding, stoichiometry, etc.) to design and
          justify a solution to a community water problem and communicate it
          through a pitch and prototype (CCSSO, 2013; PBLWorks, n.d.). This
          authentic problem gave learning a real sense of purpose. As one
          student said during the project, "I feel like a scientist solving
          something that actually matters in the world." Hearing that was
          incredibly rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Planning and Alignment:</strong> In designing the unit, I used
          the Moreland PBL lesson template and kept the InTASC standards 6-8
          evidence expectations in mind, to ensure my plans included solid
          assessment, planning, and strategy use (CCSSO, 2013). I also
          incorporated established best practices in PBL, drawing from the
          literature. Specifically, I ensured there was sustained inquiry,
          authenticity, student voice and choice, critique and revision, and a
          public product (PBLWorks, n.d.). These elements were built into
          IonicFix: students chose which local water issue to tackle
          (voice/choice), the problems were real and from their own communities
          (authenticity), the project spanned multiple weeks of research and
          experimentation (sustained inquiry), we embedded peer critique and
          iterative improvement (critique &amp; revision), and it culminated in
          a final presentation to an audience (public product). I even adopted a
          "Shark Tank" pitch format for the final presentations, where each team
          had to pitch their water solution in a 5-minute video to a panel (our
          panel included a science teacher, a school administrator, and a
          parent volunteer acting as community members). This Shark Tank
          approach was chosen as an age-appropriate format to boost motivation
          while still holding students to high academic expectations in terms of
          scientific reasoning and evidence (Hamari et al., 2014). Indeed, it
          energized the class - students were excited by the friendly
          competition and the idea of "selling" their solution, yet they knew
          they had to have solid data and a workable prototype to convince the
          judges.
        </p>

          <strong>Execution and Learning:</strong> Implementing the IonicFix
          project taught me a great deal about facilitating student-centered
          learning. In the first phase, students conducted a needs analysis of
          their chosen water issue, articulating the problem in terms of a clear
          problem statement: location + symptom + suspected ion/compound + a
          measurable way to test it (National Research Council, 2012). I guided
          them with a "spot the mistake" whole-class activity to practice
          writing testable problem statements, then gave each group a framework
          to draft their own. Using a micro-rubric, I quickly reviewed each
          group's problem statement and marked it "Ready" or "Revise," giving a
          one-sentence suggestion for improvement in Teams. This immediate
          feedback loop ensured that groups had a solid foundation before moving
          on. Next, students had to justify why their chosen ion was likely
          causing the issue, using at least one credible source. I held
          mini-conferences with each group, asking, "What evidence do you have
          for that ion?" and nudging them to find or cite a source. Here I acted
          more as a coach, pointing them to resources or giving hints rather
          than just telling them answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heart of the project was the investigation plan. Each team drafted
          a one-page proposal outlining their hypothesis, variables (IV, DV,
          controls), materials, procedure, data table design, and success
          criteria for "improved water" (National Research Council, 2012).
          Crafting this plan was challenging for many, so I broke it into parts:
          one lesson focused on variables and hypothesis, another on method and
          safety, etc. I used formative checkpoints at each step - for example,
          after a mini-lesson on identifying independent vs. dependent
          variables, I had teams fill out just the IV/DV section of their plan
          and submit it. I then quickly checked each for correctness using a
          short checklist (IV measurable? DV measurable? controls identified?)
          and immediately provided help: groups that misunderstood variables got
          a quick re-teach, while advanced groups were prompted to consider
          reliability (trials) or an error reduction strategy (Black &amp;
          Wiliam, 1998; Tomlinson, 2017). This just-in-time support kept all
          teams moving forward without frustration. It was amazing to see
          students iterate on their scientific methods in real-time; they would
          get feedback at 10am and by 10:15am be back at their desks revising
          their plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Peer Review and Revision Culture:</strong> One of the
          highlights of IonicFix was building a classroom culture of critique
          and revision. After drafting their investigation plans and pitch
          outlines, teams participated in a peer review carousel. Using a
          structured checklist that asked questions like "Is the problem
          statement clear and testable?" and "Does the solution address the
          need?" each team reviewed another team's plan. They had to give at
          least one Glow (praise) and one Grow (suggestion). Students took this
          seriously - I saw them huddled around another team's poster, debating
          what feedback to write. After the carousel, every team had peer
          feedback to consider. Crucially, we didn't stop there: I required a
          "Revision Plan" from each group, where they had to list two specific
          changes they would make based on the feedback. This step was vital in
          teaching students to actually use feedback to improve, not just
          receive it. It reinforced the idea that first drafts aren't final and
          that even their project was a learning process. The result was
          improved quality in their final proposals - for example, one group's
          initial test plan was vague about measurements, but after peer
          critique they added detailed steps with specific volumes and times,
          making their experiment much more solid. The peer review process not
          only improved the projects but also empowered students to act as
          experts and collaborators in each other's learning (Nicol &amp;
          Macfarlane-Dick, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Outcomes and Reflections:</strong> In the final stage, teams
          created their pitch decks and prototypes. Many built simple physical
          prototypes (like a mini water filter using charcoal and sand, or a
          chemical treatment kit demonstration) to accompany their presentations.
          The Shark Tank pitch presentations were a resounding success -
          students spoke with confidence about chemistry concepts like
          precipitate reactions or ion exchange as they justified their
          solutions. The panel was impressed by the creativity and scientific
          rigor the students showed. Perhaps more importantly, the students
          themselves were proud. One quiet student, who rarely spoke up in
          regular lessons, absolutely shone during her team's presentation,
          articulating the science behind their prototype passionately. It was a
          powerful reminder of how giving students ownership can draw out their
          potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me as a teacher candidate, IonicFix was a milestone. It tested my
          ability to plan a complex unit, manage a noisy collaborative
          classroom, differentiate support for each group, and trust my students
          as capable scientists. It wasn't always smooth - there were moments of
          controlled chaos, and I had to flexibly adjust timelines. But the
          experience improved my confidence tremendously. It demonstrated growth
          in InTASC Standard 7 (Planning for Instruction), since I had to
          carefully design a sequence of learning activities and scaffolds; in
          Standard 6 (Assessment), as I embedded varied formative assessments
          and adjusted teaching based on them (CCSSO, 2013); and in Standard 5
          (Application of Content), as I facilitated learners in solving an
          authentic local problem using chemistry (CCSSO, 2013; PBLWorks,
          n.d.). Perhaps most significantly, I saw firsthand how aligning my
          teaching with research-based best practices leads to better student
          outcomes. The PBLWorks "gold standard" elements I had read about were
          not just buzzwords - when put into practice, sustained inquiry,
          student voice, and a culture of critique truly ignited my students'
          engagement and learning (PBLWorks, n.d.). This project affirmed my
          belief that science education should be student-centered and relevant
          to the real world. It's an approach I am committed to carrying
          forward as part of my professional identity.
        </p>

        <h2>The Value of Feedback Cycles and Professional Development</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout my clinical practice, a recurring theme has been the value
          of feedback cycles for professional growth. In addition to informal
          feedback from teaching videos and mentor observations, the program's
          formal assignments created structured feedback opportunities that
          greatly enhanced my development. For instance, early in the semester I
          completed a Professional Growth Plan assignment where I outlined goals
          (mine focused on improving differentiation and formative assessment
          techniques). My instructor provided detailed feedback on that plan,
          challenging me to make my goals more specific and measurable. I
          revised the plan and then actively worked on those goals each week,
          effectively using it as a roadmap. Periodically, I revisited my
          progress: did I try the new questioning technique I promised to? Was I
          seeing improvement in student responses as evidence? This reflective
          goal-tracking ensured that the feedback from that initial assignment
          wasn't lost; instead, it became a living part of my practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, our cohort engaged in professional discussions and roadmap
          check-ins. In these sessions, we shared challenges and success
          strategies. Hearing a peer describe how he increased student talk time
          in his classroom gave me new ideas (I later implemented a "student
          question time" inspired by him, where I let students lead part of the
          review by asking their own questions). My participation in these
          cohort discussions and external webinars (such as a science teaching
          webinar on phenomena-based learning) helped me begin building a
          professional learning network, connecting me with educators beyond my
          school. This aligns with the program's expectations for outstanding
          teacher candidates to engage in meaningful professional development
          beyond just our coursework and to start forming a network in the
          education community (Darling-Hammond et al., 2017). I can proudly say
          I've done that - I joined an online group for chemistry teachers where
          we exchange lesson ideas, and I attended a local science teacher
          meet-up which led to exchanging contact info with a couple of
          experienced teachers who offered to mentor me informally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another key feedback cycle was the formal evaluation process by my
          university supervisor. After each formal observation, we had a debrief
          meeting. In these meetings, we would go over the InTASC standards and
          my evidence for each. At first, this felt a bit like a checklist
          exercise, but I soon realized how valuable it was in pinpointing areas
          of improvement. For example, after an observation in week 5, my
          supervisor noted that while I met Standard 4 (Content Knowledge) well,
          I needed to put more focus on Standard 2 (Learning Differences) -
          specifically, to better incorporate students' cultural backgrounds into
          lessons. We brainstormed how I could do this, and as a result I made a
          change in my teaching: I began to invite students to share examples or
          applications from their home or culture. During our unit on pH, one
          student talked about how acid rain affected the village her
          grandparents live in - this opened up a rich discussion and validated
          her experience. By the final observation, I had intentionally designed
          culturally relevant hooks or examples in each unit, and my supervisor
          commended my growth in creating inclusive, culturally responsive
          learning experiences. This example underscores how being receptive to
          feedback and willing to change resulted in concrete improvements in my
          teaching practice. It's exactly the mindset described in InTASC
          Standard 9 - embracing ongoing learning and examining the impact of my
          choices on learners (CCSSO, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, as part of our culmination, I developed a Professional
          Development Plan for my first year of teaching. In it, I identified
          future growth opportunities and set goals to continue strengthening my
          instruction based on student needs (for instance, I want to improve at
          accommodating special needs students in labs, so I plan to attend a
          workshop on inclusive science labs). Crafting this plan was a
          reflective experience that made me appreciate the continuous nature of
          teacher development. It also reinforced that I am now part of a larger
          professional community - I sought input from my mentor on which local
          PD events to attend, and I included joining the National Science
          Teachers Association (NSTA) as a goal to widen my network. In essence,
          the cycle of feedback doesn't end with this clinical practice; I am
          carrying it forward. I acknowledge that continuous learning and
          improvement can positively impact my teaching and ultimately student
          success (Darling-Hammond et al., 2017). The process of feedback -
          whether from mentors, peers, students, or self-reflection - will
          remain a staple of how I grow and refine my practice throughout my
          career.
        </p>

        <h2>Leadership and the Learning Commons Initiative</h2>
        <p>
          An unexpected area of growth for me during this practicum was stepping
          into a leadership role at my placement school. Midway through the
          semester, I was invited by my cooperating mentor and the school's
          academic coordinator to help develop a new "Parent-Teacher-Student
          Learning Commons" initiative. The idea was to transform our school's
          traditional library into a modern learning commons - a flexible,
          collaborative space that would serve as a hub for students, teachers,
          and parents to engage in learning together. This initiative was truly
          a whole-school project, and being part of the design team was both
          challenging and enlightening.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role initially involved research and gathering input. I surveyed
          students about what would make the library more inviting (their
          answers: comfy seating, a makerspace corner, and longer hours after
          school). I also attended a PTA meeting with my mentor to hear parent
          perspectives - parents were eager for a space where they could come
          after school to read with their kids or attend mini-workshops on
          supporting learning at home. Using this input, our team (which
          included two other teachers and a librarian) drafted a proposal for
          the Learning Commons. I contributed by sketching a floorplan that
          included zones for quiet reading, collaborative work, and a small
          "innovation lab" area with science kits and computers. We envisioned
          the Learning Commons as "the physical and virtual collaborative
          learning hub of the school" that emphasizes creativity,
          collaboration, and opportunities to enhance learning outcomes
          (American Association of School Librarians [AASL], 2018). In
          practical terms, we proposed extended hours one day a week
          where parents could come with students to work on homework or projects
          with teacher support available - a sort of community study night. We
          also planned rotating monthly events, like a Family STEM Night, a
          parent-child book club meeting, and student project exhibitions in the
          space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Helping design this initiative allowed me to exercise leadership and
          collaboration skills beyond my individual classroom - very much in
          line with InTASC Standard 10, which encourages teachers to seek
          leadership roles and collaborate with families and the community to
          ensure learner growth (CCSSO, 2013). I experienced first-hand what
          it's like to work with various stakeholders towards a common
          educational vision. It pushed me to consider perspectives outside the
          classroom: How can we make the space welcoming for parents who might
          not speak much English? What resources do teachers need to effectively
          use the space for cross-curricular projects? How do we align the
          Learning Commons activities with school improvement goals? I found
          myself co-leading a small presentation to the school leadership team
          to advocate for the plan, which was a great professional experience in
          communication and persuasion. Ultimately, the administration approved a
          pilot of the Learning Commons concept for next semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this project, I gained confidence in my ability to contribute
          to school-wide improvement efforts. I learned that being a
          teacher-leader is not about title or position, but about initiative
          and collaboration. Even as a student teacher, I was able to offer
          meaningful input and rally others around an idea that benefits
          students. This has shaped my professional identity - I see myself not
          just as a teacher confined to my classroom, but as an educator who is
          part of a broader community, willing to step up and lead when there's
          an opportunity to improve student learning beyond the four walls of my
          room. It was also heartening to see the excitement from students when
          we discussed the upcoming Learning Commons; several came to me with
          suggestions (one even drew her own idea of how the space should look).
          Involving students in the process was a reminder that leadership in
          education often means empowering student voice as well. All in all,
          the Learning Commons initiative became a highlight of my clinical
          practice, illustrating that my growth wasn't only in teaching
          techniques but also in collaborative leadership. I carry forward a
          strong commitment to continue taking on leadership roles in my future
          school - whether it's leading a team meeting, mentoring a colleague,
          or spearheading a new project - in order to advance the profession and
          create the best possible learning environments for students (CCSSO,
          2013).
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Gratitude, Next Steps, and Professional Identity</h2>
        <p>
          As I conclude this final reflection, I am filled with gratitude. I am
          deeply thankful to my mentor teacher, whose steady guidance, candid
          feedback, and constant encouragement created the perfect environment
          for me to learn and take risks. I am grateful to my university
          instructors and supervisors, who challenged me to align my practice
          with high standards and who were always available with advice or a
          probing question that made me think deeper. I also owe thanks to my
          peers in the cohort - our collaborative spirit (through peer reviews,
          discussion boards, and coffee chats swapping ideas) proved that we
          truly are better together in this journey. And of course, I am
          grateful to my students. They were the center of it all - every
          strategy I tried, every tool I used, was for them. Their enthusiasm,
          honesty, occasional frustration, and eventual successes taught me more
          about teaching (and myself) than any textbook could.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, I feel a strong sense of purpose and clarity about my
          next steps. I plan to carry forward the momentum of growth from these
          12 weeks straight into my first year of full-time teaching.
          Concretely, my next steps include executing the Professional
          Development Plan I created: joining the NSTA, attending a summer
          workshop on PBL in science, and continuing to improve my practice in
          differentiation and assessment as outlined in my goals. I will also
          actively seek out a mentor in my new school and maintain ties with the
          professional learning network I've begun to build, because I know now
          that teaching is not a solitary endeavor - it flourishes with
          collaboration and support. Furthermore, I intend to keep reflecting
          regularly (through journaling or maybe even blogging about my
          experiences) to ensure I remain a reflective practitioner. In fact,
          this very reflection is something I could adapt into a blog post to
          share with others, as part of my commitment to ongoing learning and
          sharing in the teaching community.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of my professional identity, I now confidently see myself as
          a chemistry educator and lifelong learner. I am a teacher who believes
          in the power of student-centered learning - whether it's through an
          engaging PBL unit like IonicFix or simply a well-timed question that
          sparks a great class discussion. I am committed to using formative
          assessment and feedback to guide students towards growth, echoing my
          core belief that every student can learn and improve when given the
          right support and high expectations. I also identify as a
          teacher-leader in the making, one who is eager to collaborate with
          colleagues and contribute positively to the school community. Most
          importantly, I am an educator who puts students first: their
          curiosity, their needs, their cultures, their voices. This experience
          has reinforced for me that teaching is far more than delivering
          content - it is about inspiring students, continually improving my
          craft, and building a community of learners that extends beyond the
          classroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          With humility and excitement, I conclude this chapter of my journey. I
          know there is so much more to learn - and I am ready. I will step into
          my next classroom carrying the lessons, experiences, and confidence
          these 12 weeks have given me. Thank you to everyone who has been part
          of this transformative journey. I move forward with gratitude, a
          commitment to excellence and equity in education, and the unwavering
          knowledge that teaching is my calling. I am proud to now join the
          ranks of professional educators, and I am committed to making a
          positive difference in the lives of my students, every day, as a
          reflective, innovative, and compassionate chemistry teacher. Here's to
          the journey ahead - one of continual growth, collaboration, and
          impactful teaching.
