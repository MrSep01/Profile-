        <p>
          As a chemistry teacher candidate, I am increasingly convinced that the biggest gains in student learning do
          not come from adding more content. They come from improving how students make meaning of chemistry ideas.
          Too often, students can complete calculations or recite definitions but struggle to explain why something
          happens at the particle level or how evidence supports a claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is exactly why I want to attend the National Science Teaching Association (NSTA) four-part web seminar
          series,
          <a
            href="https://my.nsta.org/event/wi26-enhancing-instruction-with-the-nsta-sensemaking-tool"

            rel="noreferrer"
            >"Enhancing Instruction with the NSTA Sensemaking Tool."</a
          >
          The series is scheduled for March 3, 10, 17, and 24, 2026 (7:00-8:30 PM ET), and it is designed to help
          teachers give actionable feedback on lessons and support shifts aligned with three-dimensional science
          learning (National Science Teaching Association [NSTA], 2026).

        <h2>Sensemaking Is the Missing Bridge in Chemistry Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Chemistry is a subject where students constantly translate across representations: what they observe in a lab
          (macroscopic), what they imagine in models (particulate), and what they calculate and symbolize (equations
          and numbers). When instruction is overly answer-getting, students may follow steps without developing a
          coherent explanation, especially with topics like equilibrium, bonding, stoichiometry, or acid-base
          reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>
          NSTA's sensemaking framing emphasizes that high-quality lessons integrate four attributes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Phenomena</li>
          <li>Science and engineering practices</li>
          <li>Student ideas</li>
          <li>Science ideas (disciplinary core ideas)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          That combination matters in chemistry because it pushes me to design instruction where students must use
          chemistry ideas to explain something real, not just repeat rules. A unit is not successful because students
          can calculate concentration; it is successful when they can explain why concentration changes, what evidence
          supports it, and how a model accounts for it.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Expect This Seminar Series to Change in My Teaching</h2>
        <p>
          I am not looking for another set of generic strategies. I want a usable professional tool that helps me
          audit my lessons with precision and revise them so students are doing the thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          This
          <a
            href="https://my.nsta.org/event/wi26-enhancing-instruction-with-the-nsta-sensemaking-tool"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >NSTA seminar series</a
          >
          is appealing because it focuses on applying the NSTA Sensemaking Tool to analyze lessons and generate
          actionable feedback. In other words, it is designed for the work teachers actually do: reviewing materials,
          improving tasks, and aligning instruction to deeper learning outcomes (NSTA, 2026).
        </p>

        <p>
          I am also drawn to the fact that this is a coherent four-part learning sequence rather than a single
          session. Sustained engagement is what I need to build a reliable routine: evaluate, revise, teach, collect
          evidence, and refine.
        </p>
        <p>
          That sequence gives me a practical improvement cycle I can use immediately in chemistry planning and
          assessment.
        </p>

        <h2>How I Will Apply This Immediately to Chemistry Curriculum and Assessment</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Select one lesson sequence that currently leans too heavily on procedure (notes + practice set).</li>
          <li>
            Use the Sensemaking Tool criteria to identify what is missing (for example, weak phenomenon anchoring,
            limited student ideas, or thin practice integration) (NSTA, n.d.).
          </li>
          <li>
            Revise the lesson so students begin with an explanatory problem tied to evidence and build claims with
            models and reasoning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upgrade assessment so it rewards explanation quality (claim-evidence-reasoning and model-based
            explanations) rather than only final numeric answers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collect evidence of impact through student work samples, reflection prompts, and performance on
            explanation-based questions.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This approach aligns with NSTA's broader sensemaking emphasis: lessons should be designed so students
          actively develop and use science ideas over time, rather than simply receiving information (NSTA, n.d.).
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Is Worth My Time (and Why Now)</h2>
        <p>
          Right now, I am actively strengthening my curriculum design and assessment practices. The Sensemaking Tool
          offers a way to make that work sharper: it gives me a framework to identify the difference between a busy
          chemistry lesson and a lesson that actually builds transferable understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I can consistently engineer sensemaking in my classroom, students will not just do chemistry. They will
          think chemically, explain phenomena, justify claims, and use models and evidence with confidence. That is the
          kind of chemistry learning I want to be responsible for, and it is why I want to attend this NSTA seminar
          series.
