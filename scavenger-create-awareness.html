        <h2>Inclusion in a Science Classroom: The Accessibility Audit + Redesign Sprint</h2>
        <p>
          Inclusion is not a poster on a wall. It is the moment a student who usually struggles to start actually
          starts, because the task is finally readable, doable, and fair.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was the purpose of a short classroom routine I ran with my students: an Accessibility Audit + Redesign
          Sprint. The goal was simple: take a real class artifact (lab instructions, worksheet, or slide handout),
          identify the barriers hidden inside it, then redesign it so more students can access the learning without
          lowering expectations.
        </p>
        <figure class="post-figure">
          <img
            src="assets/scavenger/inclusion-audit-closeup.jpg"
            alt="Close-up of students comparing before and improved lab instructions and annotating access barriers."
            loading="lazy"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Students compared the original "Before" instructions with an improved, more accessible version and
            annotated barriers in real time.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Why This Activity Matters</h2>
        <p>
          A lot of inclusion efforts unintentionally become "extra help" after the lesson. This routine flips that
          model:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not ask students to adapt to confusing materials.</li>
          <li>We adapt the materials so students can participate meaningfully.</li>
          <li>The academic target stays the same; what changes is access.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Inclusion, in practice, often comes down to reducing three common barriers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Language barriers, especially for multilingual learners.</li>
          <li>Cognitive load caused by dense directions or unclear sequencing.</li>
          <li>Participation barriers when students only get one way to show understanding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The redesign sprint is a fast way to make those barriers visible and fixable.</p>

        <h2>The Pedagogy Behind It</h2>
        <p>
          Even though it can look like a worksheet clean-up, this routine is grounded in strong learning science and
          inclusive practice.
        </p>
        <h3>1. Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Thinking</h3>
        <p>
          Students learn that accessibility is not a special add-on for a few learners. It is strong design for all
          learners. Redesign moves typically include clearer goals and success criteria, multiple ways to engage with
          the task, and multiple ways to express understanding.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Cognitive Load Theory</h3>
        <p>
          Many students do not struggle because the science is too hard. They struggle because the instructions are too
          dense. By chunking, sequencing, and highlighting key steps, students reduce extraneous load and can focus on
          the actual learning.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Formative Assessment Disguised as Collaboration</h3>
        <p>
          While groups audit the "Before" artifact, I can see instantly where students get stuck, which vocabulary is
          unclear, and which steps students assume versus actually understand. That is formative assessment without
          feeling like a test.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Metacognition and Academic Language</h3>
        <p>
          Students practice naming why something is confusing: too many steps, unclear command words, missing examples,
          or vague success criteria. When students can name barriers, they can design better solutions.
        </p>

        <figure class="post-figure">
          <img
            src="assets/scavenger/inclusion-audit-classroom.jpg"
            alt="Whole-class view of BEFORE and IMPROVED posters used during accessibility redesign sharing."
            loading="lazy"
          />
          <figcaption>
            We made inclusion visible by treating accessibility as a design problem, then sharing redesign decisions
            with the class.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>What Students Actually Did (30-45 Minutes)</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Barrier Hunt (5-10 min)</h3>
        <p>
          Groups received an authentic class artifact and identified barriers such as long unstructured text, unclear
          command words, missing worked examples, no success criteria, or only one pathway to complete the task.
        </p>
        <p>Each group used roles to stay focused:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reader</li>
          <li>Barrier Hunter</li>
          <li>Designer</li>
          <li>Quality Checker</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Redesign Sprint (15-20 min)</h3>
        <p>
          The rule was non-negotiable: do not water down the science, improve access to the science. Students usually
          redesigned by chunking instructions into numbered steps, adding vocabulary support, adding a worked example,
          clarifying success criteria, and offering more than one response format.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3: Micro-Presentations (5-10 min)</h3>
        <p>Each group gave a short 60-second pitch:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Our biggest barrier was...</li>
          <li>We changed...</li>
          <li>This makes it more inclusive because...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is where the learning lands. Students start seeing inclusion as intentional design, not charity and not
          lowering the bar.
        </p>

        <h2>Why It Works with Boys (and Why It Scales)</h2>
        <p>
          In a boys' classroom, engagement often spikes when learning is task-based, time-bounded, collaborative, and
          visible. This routine feels like a mission: find the problem, improve the product, justify the design.
        </p>
        <p>It also scales quickly across contexts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lab safety sheets</li>
          <li>Exam-style question packs</li>
          <li>Project rubrics</li>
          <li>Revision guides before tests</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I Keep Private (and Why)</h2>
        <p>
          When documenting inclusion work, I protect student privacy by focusing visuals on hands, materials, board
          displays, and classroom layout. No student faces and no identifying school details. The goal is to show the
          learning design, not to put students on display.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection: Inclusion as a Design Habit</h2>
        <p>
          The most useful shift for me is this: inclusion is not a separate lesson, it is a design habit. When
          students help redesign materials, two things happen at once. They gain access to the task, and they learn how
          learning is built and how to make it fair for more people. That is the classroom culture I want.
        </p>

        <h2>InTASC Alignment</h2>
        <p>
          This Accessibility Audit + Redesign Sprint aligns directly with InTASC 2 (Learning Differences) because I
          proactively identified and removed barriers that can prevent learners from accessing rigorous content,
          especially barriers related to language demand, processing load, and task clarity, by redesigning core
          instructional artifacts rather than providing extra help after the fact. It also aligns with InTASC 3
          (Learning Environments) because students worked in structured, collaborative roles to co-create norms of
          respect, equity, and shared responsibility for learning, making inclusion visible as a classroom expectation.
          Using UDL principles, I strengthened access through clearer goals and success criteria, improved
          representation through chunked instructions, visuals, and vocabulary supports, and multiple options for
          engagement and expression, ensuring more students could participate meaningfully while maintaining high
          academic expectations.
